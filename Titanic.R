# INSTRUCTIONS
# Have a look at the str() of the titanic dataset, which has been loaded into your workspace. Looks like the data is pretty tidy! 
# First, have a look at the distribution of sexes within the classes of the ship. Use ggplot() with the data layer set to titanic. 
# Map factor(Pclass) onto the x axis, factor(Sex) onto fill and draw a dodgy bar plot using geom_bar(). By dodgy we mean that position has to be set to "dodge".
# These bar plots won't help you estimate your chances of survival. Copy the previous bar plot, but this time add a facet_grid() layer: ". ~ Survived".
# You want to include the final variable in the plot, Age. Start off by copying the previous ggplot() command. Add a mapping of Age onto the y axis. 
# Replace geom_bar() with geom_jitter() and set its attributes size to 3, alpha to 0.5 and position set to posn.j. 
# Make sure that factor(Sex) is mapped onto col instead of fill this time to correctly color the scatter plots.
